# ice4

The code for the three methods is under Program.java which is located under the src folder.

The test class can be found in ice4/test/Program and is called ProgramTest.java
The test class tests for good bad conditions on all methods and for boundary conditions on two of the methods (the third method returned a boolean and didn't lend itself for a boundary test that relevant).
